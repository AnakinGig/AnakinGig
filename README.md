## Hello there 👋

I'm **Anakin**, a software development and cybersecurity student based in France 🇫🇷

I mainly work on **backend development**, with a strong focus on:

* Flask, PHP
* Redis
* OpenAPI design

I also enjoy doing **frontend work** when needed, using tools like React and Bootstrap, usually starting from designs made in Figma.

This is my main GitHub profile, where I publish public projects I’m actively working on, experimenting with, or just building for fun.
Everything you’ll find here is fresh, hands-on, and straight from my brain 🧠
