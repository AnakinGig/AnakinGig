# Hello there 👋

I'm Anakin, a software and cybersecurity student from France.

I'm mostly working on backend -- Flask, PHP, Redis, OpenAPI

I also do some frontend like React or Bootstrap with Figma as a base.

This is my main profile where i'll have public projects i'm working on, experimenting or just having fun.
Everything you'll see here is fresh from my brain.
